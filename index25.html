    <p style="color:gold"> But I must explaine to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system and expound the actual teaching of the great explorer of the truth the master-builder of <b> Human Happines.No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desire to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasuer.



      <h2> Why do we use it? </h2>
      
       It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <u> Lorem Ipsum </u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,as opposed to using''content here, content here'', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packges and web page editors now use <b> Lorem Ipsum </b> as their default model text, and a search for ''lorem ipsum'' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy  Various versions have envolved over the years, sometimes  by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). 
       <!-- the text above will be rendered the way it is written on our code -->



           <h3> Where can I get some? </h3>
            <p> There are many variation of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,or <u> randomize words. </u> which don't look  even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embrrassing hidden in the middle of tex. <em> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the internet tend to repeat perdefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generetor on the internet</em><strong> It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks resonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free repetition, injected humour,or non-charecteristic words etc.</strong>
